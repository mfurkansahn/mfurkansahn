### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mustafa Furkan SAHIN
#### Design and Development

I graduated in computer engineering at Turkish Aeronautical Association University. I have worked as an intern at Roof Stacks in the game developer department 2 months in 2021. During my internship, I developed games with C# and modelling with Blender. I have also worked on the development of the new version of the system used in the highway, railway and aviation sectors using React when I was an intern at Ortana Electronic Software Contracting Inc in 2022. I developed projects in Python and MsSQL. I made a Site Management Program in Senior Project. I am also interested in website development. I continue to further strengthen my knowledge by receiving training from online platforms.

Skills: UNITY / BLENDER / C# / REACT / HTML / JS / CSS
